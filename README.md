    <h1>“Grow a Garden” – A Cashgrab in Disguise</h1>
    <p>
      “Grow a Garden” may look fun at first glance, but it's a textbook example of an unoriginal Roblox cashgrab.
      Like many low-effort simulators, it relies heavily on repetitive gameplay, flashy thumbnails, and overpriced gamepasses to hook players — especially younger users.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game features basic mechanics: click, grow, upgrade — repeat. There's minimal creativity or challenge, and most upgrades are locked behind Robux paywalls.
      Its popularity isn't because it's innovative — it's because it’s aggressively advertised and algorithm-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Games like this flood the front page, making it harder for quality indie developers to get noticed. They devalue the platform by prioritizing monetization over fun, originality, or community-building.
      Roblox becomes less about discovery and creativity, and more about how much money a dev can milk from the player base.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players deserve better. Support original, well-crafted games — not factory-made clickers chasing trends.
